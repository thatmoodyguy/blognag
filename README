== Welcome to Blognag!

NOTE:  The Blognag service is not currently running.  This code is published for legacy purposes.

Blognag is a Twitter-based service that reminds you when you haven't posted to your blog in a while, so you'll be encouraged to keep your blog content fresh!

All you have to do is tweet a message to Blognag, like this:

@blognag add http://myblog.com

To remove a blog from the list, tweet:

@blognag remove http://myblog.com

Or, to remove all of your blogs from the daily nag message:

@blognag remove all

Enjoy!
